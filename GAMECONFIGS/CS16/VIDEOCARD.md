## NVIDIA
- **Ambient Occlusion**
  - *Not supported for this application*
- **Anisotropic Filtering**
  - Application Controlled
    - In-game options are available to control this, **gl_ansio**
- **Antialiasing - FXAA**
  - Use global setting (Off)
- **Gamma Correction**
  - Off
- **Antialiasing Mode**
  - Use global setting (Application-controlled) or use a custom value
  - Antialiasing can be disabled ingame using the **-nomsaa** launch option, otherwise there is limited control for this feature in the game.
- **Antialiasing Setting**
  - Dependant on the previous setting, if set to Application Control it will be greyed out.
- **Antialiasing Transparency**
  - Use global setting (Off)
- **CUDA - GPUs**
  - If you have one video card leave as Use global setting (All), otherwise choose the GPU you would like to use.
- **Maximum pre-rendered frames**
  - Use global setting (Use the 3D application setting)
  - This can be lowered to slightly reduce buffer latency however it may also cause inconsistency in some games or systems.
- **Multi-Frame Sampled AA (MFAA)**
  - Use global setting (Off)
- **OpenGL rendering GPU**
  - If you have one video card leave as Use global setting (Auto-select), otherwise choose the GPU you would like to use.
- **Power management mode**
  - Prefer maximum performance
- **Preferred refresh rate**
  - Use global setting (Application-controlled)
- **Shader Cache**
  - Use global setting (On)
  - You may also try it with off, this feature is intended to improve rendering performance however it will increase disk activity instead of CPU overhead.
- **Texture Filtering - Anisotropic sample optimization**
  - Use global setting (Off), this setting only applies to DirectX programs, CS 1.6 uses OpenGL.
- **Texture Filtering - Negative LOD bias**
  - Use global setting (Allow)
- **Texture Filtering - Quality**
  - High performance
- **Texture Filtering - Triliear optimization**
  - Use global setting (On), this setting only applies to DirectX programs, CS 1.6 uses OpenGL.
- **Threaded optimization**
  - Off, having this on may increase latency but improve fps. As this is an old game it is recommended to leave this off as per the Nvidia control panel suggestion.
- **Triple buffering**
  - Use global setting (Off)
- **Vertical sync**
  - Use global setting (Use the 3D application setting)
  - In-game options are available to control this, **gl_vsync**
- **Virtual Reality pre-rendered frames**
  - Use global setting (1)
