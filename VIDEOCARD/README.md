## Dedicated video card drivers and settings
Download the latest drivers, install and configure your settings for ideal and consistent performance

### NVIDIA
1. Go to https://www.geforce.com/drivers and download the latest applicable drivers for your video card
2. Install the drivers, during the installation choose custom installation, check **Perform a clean install** and **uncheck all of the following**:
   - HD Audio Driver
   - Physx System Software
   - 3D Vision Driver
   - 3D Vision 
   - NVIDIA Geforce Experience
3. Complete the rest of the steps and wait for the process to complete
4. After the installation is complete right click on your desktop and choose NVIDIA Control Panel
5. Go to **Adjust image settings with preview**, and **Use my preference emphasizing:** set the slider to **Performance**
6. Go to Resolution set the refresh rate to 120hz or higher for your desktop experience
   - A lower value may be fine for desktop use and most games will allow you to override this setting via game launch option. e.g. -freq 144
7. Go to **Adjust desktop size and position** and choose **Perform Scaling on GPU**, and choose **No Scaling**
8. Under **Manage 3D Settings** then **Program Settings**
   - You may want to disable **Shader Cache** for your specific game or globally, this setting can in some cases cause inconsistent experience but after a longer period of time may improve performance when enabled once more information has been cached. Leave this off to start.
   - **Max pre-rendered Frames** this may lower overall latency but may also negatively impact overall performance or experience, leave this at **Use the 3D application setting**
   - **Power management mode**: Leave this at Optimal Power globally
9. Avoid adjust any of the color settings initially such as Digital Vibrance, Brightness, or Contrast. Ensure your gaming experience is running smoothly first for a few days or up to a week, then slowly start to add new features to your build.
   - Games may also provide options ingame for improving visual effects, colors or quality, try these first.
10. Leave all other settings at the NVIDIA recommended high performance defaults.
11. Avoid micro adjusting settings then playing for a few minutes then trying again.

Settings such as Max pre-rendered Frames are controversial, some will say enable it but not every PC will behave the same with it at a low value even on high powered PCs. Many gaming professionals use the default setting and still perform at the highest levels.
