### Radio Frequency Interference
#### Q: What types of near field radio frequencies do monitors and DVI cables create? Does the color or activity on screen change the radiated emissions?
An LCD monitor may radiate different ranges of near field emissions based on serveral different factors such as the colors displayed and monitors refresh rate, during the few brief experiments it was found that a Benq GL2450 60hz monitor may radiate in the range of 150-800MHz with stronger signals at 150, 280-380, 450 and 590MHz.

The display cable itself generates frequencies more notably at 82.5 to 84.5MHz depending on the monitors activity, if no active content is being rendered the emissions are not as pronounced similarly as when a single ferrite is applied. See findings and analysis for more information.
